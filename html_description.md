Gallery for the [Spirulae](https://spirulae.github.io) graphing calculator.
Includes reverse chronologically ordered unfiltered images (everything) scraped from Discord where I sent screenshots to when developing spirulae.
Intended to be a progress overview rather than a showcase gallery.

- `2023-11`: complex support for all graphers, path tracing denoise
- `2023-10`: more path tracer parameters, mesh decimation, robust parser
- `2023-09`: 2D vector field / ODE grapher
- `2023-07`: initial path tracer, mesh generation, rename to `spirulae`
- `2023-05`: scalar field visualization, box clip
- `2023-03`: parametric surface grapher
- `2023-02`: special real functions
- `2022-09`: 2D implicit grapher, 2D and 3D complex graphers
- `2022-08`: move to `spirula` repository
- `2022-04`: gradient color, autodiff, function/variable definition
- `2022-03`: start `raymarching-implicit`, basic renderer and parser
